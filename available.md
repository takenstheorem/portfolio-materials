**De-Automated #2 - #10 // Patternbase x Takens Theorem** ([post](https://twitter.com/im_not_art/status/1695832292306948352))

Project from late 2023, with physical item reedemable as a representation of human-transformed data: 'Our information space, already saturated, now grows in tidal waves of content from artificial neural networks. De-Automated expresses the desire many of us have to go in reverse. To reclaim artifacts of our digital environment back into ones that echo the presence of fellow minds. We bring automation to heel by appropriating it.'

**Identity_{i/j/k}; 3 available in G/L Space** ([post](https://twitter.com/hex6c/status/1678409404574576643))

Contribution to SuperRare space to illustrate web3 concepts. In this study, raw data from gnosis safes that illustrate the interconnected nature of identity. From the organizers: 'We are born in a certain place at a certain time. We are assigned a name. This is our first identity. It is a formal, centralized identity, kept in State archives. It does not really say much about us.'
